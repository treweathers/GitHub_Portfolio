          <h4 className="black"> This basic Web Scraper is made with Scrapy in Python and the data is saved as json files.
                I began scraping Legal data from government websites such as pulling articles from the Constitution full text online.
                In the future when parsing data for a larger AI project, I will focus on deploying and automation with Azure PostgreSQL and GitHub Actions.
                In addition, I will pivit to looking for websites to scrape that are better formatted and therefore better to parse through.
